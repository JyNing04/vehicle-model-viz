# Dynaviz ðŸš—ðŸ“ˆ
*A vehicle dynamics model validation & visualization tool*

This repository provides visualization tools to validate vehicle dynamics models using **matplotlib animation**.  
It helps compare simulated vehicle states against ground truth data with dynamic, interactive plots.

---

## Features
- Animated visualization of vehicle trajectories on track
- Side-by-side comparison of ground truth vs. model predictions
- Support for multiple states (position, velocity, yaw, etc.)
- Easy to extend for new models and datasets
